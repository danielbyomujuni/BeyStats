    }],
    "mainService": "",
    "readCharacteristic": "",
    "writeCharacteristic": "",
    "debugLaunchData": {
      "header": {

      },
      "launches": [0],

The App does not use any third-party services that require sharing your personal data.

**3. Security**  
While we collect data only for bug reports, we take reasonable measures to ensure that your data remains secure during this process. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.

**4. Changes to This Privacy Policy**  
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any updates.
